Hi! I am a Research Scholar at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, working under the guidance of [Dr. Prathosh A.P.](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home?authuser=0). \\
\\
 I completed my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT Patna). Nowadays, I am focussing on different ways to use Energy Based Models (EBMs) in unsupervised settings.  Specifically, a typical EBM is trained using [contrastive divergence loss](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~ojw/files/NotesOnCD.pdf) which requires samples from the target distribution which requires some sort of supervision. I wonder if there is some way to circumvent this. \\
 \\
In an earlier life, I worked on solving the problem of localization in indoor environment using deep learning methods. I was blessed to have [Dr. Sudhir Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/ksudhiriitk/) (Assistant Professor, IIT Patna) as guide during my B.Tech. I worked for about 3.5 years under him. In the course of my bachelors, I also had opportunity to collaborate with [Dr. Sajal K. Das](https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/sdas/home) and [Dr. Moustafa Youssef](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r6DUyxsAAAAJ&hl=en). \\
\\
If you are interested in discussing about theoretical interpretation of deep learning models in general, please ping me I am always excited to have these sorts of discussion.
